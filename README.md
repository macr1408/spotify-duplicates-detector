## Stack Used

- Vite
- React
- Typescript
- Axios
- string-similarity-js
- Tailwind + headlessui
- Docker

## Possible improvements:

- UI/UX experience for the popup (show "loading" when clicking on a playlist). Can be done with `type Status = 'idle' | 'loading' | 'ready' | 'error'`
- Code organization can be improved. Quality wise looks ok.
- (OPTIONAL) Overall App presentation
